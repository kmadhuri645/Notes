Questions on filehandling
final finally finalize.
Diff b/w checked and unchecked exception
Throw throws difference



Method overloading and overriding programs 
What are access specifier, modifier, and return type
Program on inheritance scenario take 1 parent class, 1 child class and 1 class for main method Create an object for both classes in main method and asked output order
oops concept in project
Can you make constructor as private ❌
Can you able to create object for private constructor ❌
polymorphism.
What is Abstract class
Contructor
This keyword
mention 5 basic standards to write good Java program.
Oops concepts in your framework
abstract class syntax 
concept of upcasting and downcasting
Difference b/w = and ==
without main method can we execute  java program
can we override private method? Why
why we can't override static method ?
Oops Concept explianation
abstract class interface diff
Diff b/w method overloading and overriding
Difference b/w compile time and runtime  polymorphism
write a simple program to implements all the opps concepts.
Which java version you used? & What are the new things added in 17
what is super keyword where you are going to use super keyword
you are having individual classes called classA and classB having some functionalities , i want those functionalities in in classC, what is your approach
if file is not found ,which exception
What is constructor chaining?
Can Interface have a constructor?
Explain Access Modifiers?
What is Binary search(with program).
What is the time complexity for bubble sort?
Which is the latest jdk version you have used?
can we create an object of interface?
Can u parameterize Constructor inside an abstract class ?
Can u define variables inside abstract class Constructor construct?
When u will get classnotfound exception?
Why can't you achieve full abstraction using an abstract class
what is singleton class
Why you used getter and setters in selenium script
CustomException
Singleton
concurrentHashmap
Lambda expression

Output
try{
}
catch(Exception e){
return 40;
}
finally{
return 60;
}

Output - 
try {
int a = 40 / 0;
} catch (Exception e) {
return 40;
}
finally {
return 60;
}

Write the logic for the palindrome in different approaches and less time complexity, and space complexity
Employee emp1 = new Employee(“Ram”,10000, 101,23)
Employee emp2 = new Employee(“Shyam”,20000, 102,34)
Employee emp3 = new Employee(“Rahul”,30000, 103,43)
Above are the details of employee, so how will you add the employee data with the help
of HashMap where key is the employeeName . Write logic for it.






Convert the String a = "12345"; into intConvert the String a = "12345"; into int
