1.Difference between Implicit Wait vs Explicit Wait.

Implicit Wait:

Implicit wait is applied to the findElement or findElements methods.
If the condition is not satisfied, it will eventually throw a "No Such Element" exception.
It applies to all elements in the script.
It is generally slower compared to explicit wait, as it is applied globally.
no need to create object

Explicit Wait:

Explicit wait is used to wait for a specific condition to be true.
If the condition is not satisfied within the timeout period, it throws a "Timeout" exception.
You write explicit wait for each element separately.
It is generally faster than implicit wait because it is applied only to the specific elements you target.
object creation

2.Explain abstraction?
abstraction in a one of the pillers of the opps.
abstraction is nothing but it hiding the implementation and show the functionality of the aplications is called as abstraction.
we cant create object of abstration
we can create consturucter.

3.Difference between collections and collection?
collections--it is a class,
it has concreate method
 collections methods are concreate and static in nature
2.Collections does not have any subinterface.
3.iteratable interface is super interface for collection.
it is final class .


collection---it is an interface,
collection  and non static abstract method.
object class is parent class of collection
collection depends on 3 subinterface list queue and set
it is implemented by other class
//conction is a group of object .collection provide method to perform curd operation on the 

4. How do you handle dropdown?
by using select class we can handle the dropdwon.

============================================================================================
1. How do you validate your response in API?
here we can verify the response in different way -by using assert method as well as jsonpath and 
xpath.for example if i want to 
verify response header----/by status code/statuscode/status line/content type/header.
verify response time,by using matchers class
verify respone body --by using json path.and json x-path.

2. Why are you using interface for storing paths and credentials in your framework?
To store the constant path.bcz it is by default static in nature.

3. Have you used fluent wait? WAJP to use fluent wait in a program?
To avoid synchronisation issue .
HERE we can change polling frequency
we can handle exception.

4. What will happen when you give priority =-1,-2 in TestNG
first --2 will be execute first than -1 will get execute

5. when do you get NoSuchElementException?
when  element is not visible in web page we get this exception.
ui changes
page loading
locator is wrongs.

6. Why are you using implicit wait as precondition?
To intract with the web element will provider iw bcz once the app is lauch its take the time 
to load the element on that web page. 
To avoid NoSuchElementException
it is a global wait.

10.Advantage of lamda expression

1.We can provide multiple implementation using multiple lamda expression
2.we need to write implementing class.
3.we need to write method declaration
4.we can pass method implementation as an input to another method

1.WHAT ALL CHALLENGES ARE INCLUDED UNDER API Testing

1.Api documentation---to test api we need endpoints/resources/parameters/payload
2.Access to DB===This happens when api are from third party company where their database details are not shared
3.Authorization Over head======

2. WHAT IS DIFFERENCE B/W PUT AND POST METHODS?

POST request-- creating a new object on the server
PUT request ,Update the object in server with new value.

3.WHAT ARE COMMONLY USED HTTP METHODS??
GET:it enables you to retrive data from a server
POST: it enables you to add Data to an existing file or resource in server
PUT: It lets you replace an existing file or resource in a server.
DELETE: it lets you delete data from a server.

4.LISTOUT FEW AUTHENTICATION TECHNOQUES USED IN API'S??
1.Session/Cookies Based Authentication
2.Basic Authentication---usename&password send
3.Digest Authentication
4.OAuth

5.WHY API TESTING IS DETERMINED AS THE MOST SUITABLE FROM FOR AUTOMATION TESTING.
==BCZ it is a lighter wait testing and its more stable than UI testing(UI testing is more flicky bcz internet is not proper
or maybe browser do not support latested version of selenium so test might break in middle).but in api no changes to break it
bcz it not depends upon any external resources.like loading the page etc...

6.WHAT IS REST Api
REST stands for Representation State Transfer. it is a set of functions/api helping developers in performing request and 
receive responses.Interaction is made through HTTP Protocal in Rest Api.

7.WHAT EXACTLY NEEDS TO VERIFY IN API TESTING.
==In API testing we we send a request to API with the known data and then analysis the response.
1. we will verify the accuracy of the data.
2. will see the HTTP status code.
3.we will see the response time.
4.Error codes in case API returns any errors.
5.Authorization would be check.
6.Non-Functional testing such as performance testing, secutity testing.

8.WHAT ARE PATH PARAMETERS AND QUERY PARAMETERS FOR BELOW Api
http:/rahulshetttyaacademy.com/orders/112234?location=IND

path parameters is identify with slace in the url.here two parameters is there one is 112234 2is location=ind
if parameters prefix with slash that is path parameters.
and whenever we have ? before parameters is call queryparameters.

9.WHAT ARE THE CODE COMPONENTS OF AN HTTP REQUEST?
1.HTTP Request methods like: PUT ,POST,DELETE.
2.Base Uniform Resource Identifier(URI)
3.Resources and PARAMETERS.
4.Request Header, which carries metadata(as key-value pairs) for the HTTP Request message.
5.Request Body , which indicates the message content or resource representation.

10.WHAT COULD BE THE HTTP METHOD FOR BELOW API SCENARIOS? ANSWER IF IT IS GET OR POST.

SCENARIOS-An api which has Endpoint,parameters,headers,cookies and payload---POST. (BCZ OF PAYLOAD)

11.WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCE B/W API TESTING AND UI Testing.
UI(User Interface) testing means ,the testing of graphical user interface.The focus of ui testing is on the look and
feel of application.In user interface testing the main focus is on how users can interact with app elements such as images,
fonts,layout etc. are checked.

API testing allows the communication b/w two s/w system.Api testing works on backend also known as backend testing.
api communicating b/w differnt server through all the https request.so there is no frontend here.all the requst send through
the protocol if we deal with rest than http protocol.if rest soap protocol.

12.WHAT PROTOCOL IS USED BY THE RESTFUL WEB SERVICES?
RESTFUL Webservices uses the HTTP protocol.They use the HTTP protocol as a medium of communication b/w the client and server.

13.WHAT ARE SOAP Webservices?
SOAP stands for simple ojbect access protocol .it is an XML based messaging protocol. it helps in exchanging infomation among
computors.

14.HOW DO WE REPRESENT A RESOURCES IN REST ?.
==Using HTTP METHODS.

15.CAN YOU USE GET Request INSTEAD OF PUT TO CREATE A RESOURCES?
==No GET request only allows read only rights. it enables you to retrive data from a server but not created a resource.
PUT or POST methods should be used to create a resource.

POST should be used when the client sends the pages to server and then the server lets the client know where it put it.
PUT should be used when the client specifies the location of the page.

16.CAN YOU USE POST REQUEST INSTED OF PUT TO CREATE A Resource?
==YES WE CAN .BCZ POST IS SUPER SET OF ALL OTHER HTTP METHODS EXCEPT GET.

17. WHAT DO YOU UNDERSTAND BY PAYLOAD IN RESTFUL WEB SERVICE?
==Payload/body is the secured input data which is sent to API to process the request.
Payload is generally represented in Json format in Rest Api's.

18.HOW DO WE DIFFERENTIATE PATH AND QUERY PARAMETERS IN API REQUEST Endpoint.
Generally queryparameters constructed end of the url..
if it is / than path ...if it is ? mark than it is query parameters.

19.WHAT IS RESTASSURED.
it is java library which can automate Rest Api's.

20.HOW WOULD WE DEFINE API DETAILS IN REST ASSURED AUTOMATION??
==We shall define all the request details and send it to server in given(),when(),then() methods.

21.WHAT IS JSON SERIALIZATION AND DESERIALIZATION IN RESTASSURED?
==SERIALIZATION in RestAssured context is a process of converting a java object into Request body(Payload).
RestAssured also Supports deserialization by converting Response body back to java object.

22.LISTOUT FEW COMMON JSON PARSING TECHNOQUES USED IN RestAssured AUTOMATION?
JSON PATH
Deserialization of json using POJO Classes.,gson Library

23.How would you send attachments to API USING REST ASSURED TEST?

==using multipart methods.

24.DIFFERENCE STATUS CODES AND THEIR DESCRIPTIONS
200-OK== the request was successfully completed.
201-Created=== the request was successfully completed.
400-Bad Request==The request was invalid.
401-Unauthorized===The request did not include an authentication token or the authentication token was expired.
403-Forbidden==The client did not have permission to access the requested resources.
404-Not Found--The requested resource was not found.
405-Method not allowed--The Http method in the request was not supported by the resource.For example the delete method can not use post
409-Conflict===The request could not be completed due to a conflict.for example post contentStore Folder Api cannot complete if the api in parent location.

500-Internal Server Error===The request was not completed due to an internal error on the server side.
503-Service Unavaliable==The server was unaavailable.
